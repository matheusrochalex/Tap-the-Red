# Tap-the-Red
Tap the Red: final project for CS 298 - Embedded Systems, a mini-game designed on a breadboard connected to an Arduino

This project entailed the usage of different pieces of hardware studied in the embedded systems course in order to create any machine or any working computer of our choosing.
Tap the Red is a simple game where a 4x4 display would continually change between colors, and players must hit the red button when the display color changes to red.
At every successful hit, the game gets progressively faster, and the player wins once every "level" (differentiated by the speed in which colors change) is passed.

The project was coded in C++, and the components used were:

- Breadboard
- Arduino Mini
- 4x4 LED display
- 7-segment display
- Toggle button
- Cardboard
- Red tape

The .ino file is the file that was transferred to the Arduino board in order to run the game.
